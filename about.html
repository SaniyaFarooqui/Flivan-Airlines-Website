            <h1>About Flivan</h1>
            <p>Each year, the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society celebrates the worlds first airline and its record-breaking pilot, Tony Jannus. And where was this airline? New York? Chicago? London? Berlin?
              No. The worlds first airline originated in St. Petersburg, Florida.
              The worlds first regularly scheduled heavier-than-air airline took off from the Municipal Pier in St. Petersburg on New Years Day 1914. The airline was known as the St. Petersburg_Tampa Airboat Line. It was organized just a few months before that New Years first takeoff. The airline was the brainchild of Percival E. Fansler, a Jacksonville-based electrical engineer. Fansler enlisted the support of Thomas Benoist (pronounced ben-wah), an early airplane manufacturer who provided the planes-or, more precisely, the airboats. The airboat was known as Benoist Airboat Model XIV, no. 43. The model number referred to the year in which the plane was to be offered for sale (1914). The number indicated that it was the forty-third aircraft to be built from initiation of the Benoist Aeroplane Company.
